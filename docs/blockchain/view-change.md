# View change

---

The Albatross consensus algorithm was built to adapt its behavior in case some validators act maliciously.

The view change protocol is inspired by the PBFT algorithm, tolerating up to one-third of malicious validators. When a validator fails to produce a block because it went offline, or even if it purposely wants to delay the block, other validators request a view change on the current validator.

<br/>

**View change protocol**
{: .fs-5 }

A view change is a change of the view slot, and it occurs every time a validator does not produce the new block in a preset time Δ. When a validator delays producing a block, the rest of the validators from the [validators slot list](/albatross-doc/docs/blockchain/slots) will request a view change by sending a view change message. This protocol only runs in micro blocks, since macro blocks have another protocol to deal with delays.

_Figure 1 - the block number is inside of the block and the view number is under the block._

<br/>

To choose a new validator, a random seed from the previous block and the new view number are used to select the new validator to produce the micro block. This new view slot has Δ time to produce the block.

Using figure 1 as a reference, after the validator finishes producing block 3 and the slot for block 4 is randomly chosen, the new validator has Δ time to produce block 4. The validator will run an algorithm following these steps:

1. Wait for a new block; if the block is produced, the algorithm terminates, and a new block is added to the blockchain.
2. If the time elapses, request a view change by sending a view change message to the network. Wait for either a new block or 2𝑓+1 view change messages.
3. If the block is received from the delayed validator, it is added to the blockchain. If 2𝑓+1 view change messages are received, a new validator is selected and the algorithm restarts in step 1.

It is necessary to consider these aspects:

- A view change can be requested after the preset time for producing the new block has elapsed.
- Given 3𝑓+1 validators, considering 𝑓 to be malicious, it is required 2𝑓+1 view change messages to proceed with the protocol, otherwise, the validator must wait for a new block or 2𝑓+1 view change messages.
- When a view change happens, the view number increases by one, therefore, the chain with priority is the one with the highest view number.
- If a validator receives 2𝑓+1 view change messages, it won't accept a block from the delayed validator. The outcome of receiving 2𝑓+1 view change messages is always a view change in the validator.
- If the delayed validator produces several blocks, they will be reverted once 2𝑓 + 1 view change messages are received.
- The view change message is signed and sent by a validator slot. A validator that holds 𝑥 validator slots, signs 𝑥 messages.

**View change message**
{: .fs-5 }

A view change message is sent when an elected validator requests a view change. It sends a message to the rest of the elected validators containing these fields below:

**Block number** `u32`: The number of the micro block that is being produced (block number 4 in figure 1)

**View number** `u32`: The view number of the micro block that should be in production (block 4, view number 1 in figure 1)

**Previous random Seed** `VrfEntropy`: The random seed of the previous micro block (block number 3 in figure 1)


The view change message is signed and sent by each validator slot.

<br/>

**View change proof**
{: .fs-5 }

When a view change is requested and the validators run the view change algorithm, the block must include a view change proof, proving that a view change occurred in that block. This proof is added to the micro block justification and is an optional field, since a view change may not happen in a block. The proof consists of the aggregated BLS signature of the slots who have signed the view change message.
